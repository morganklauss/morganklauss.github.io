									<h2>Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others</h2>
									
									Sara Ahmed. 2006. Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others. Duke University Press. ISBN: <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/queer-phenomenology" target="_blank">978-0-8223-3914-4</a>
									<br><br>

									<h3>Introduction: Find Your Way</h3>

									This book focuses on orientation: how we find our way in the world, how we know where we are, how we get from one place to another, how we are turned towards 
									certain objects that are helpful to our navications. Specifically, how do we orient towards sexuality, as in sexual orientation? Ahmed writes "if orientation is a 
									matter of how we reside in space, then sexual orientation might also be a matter of residence; of how we inhabit spaces as well as 'who' or 'what' we inhabit 
									spaces with" (pg. 1). The purpose of the focus of orientation is to discuss how queer studies might be closer tied to phenomenology, the philosophical study of first person
									 consciousness and experiences. Ahmed chose phenomonology because of its focused on orientation as the central thesis that "consciousness is always directed 
									 'toward' an object, and given its emphasis on the lived exeperience of having a body" (a la Husserl's living body) (pg. 2). She states that a queer phenomenology might orient us towards objects otherwise 
									 "less proximate" or deviant, but beyond queer objects, she posits queer phenomenology as a way of exploring the oritentation of phenomenology itself (pg. 3). This book seeks to make two points: 
									 queering phenomenology and moving queer theory towards phenomenology. <br><br>

									 Ahmed poses that orientation is often unnoticed, and it is in moments of disorientation we might notice what it means to be orientated (pg. 6). 
									 Kant discusses the orientation of oneself while blindfolded in an unfamiliar room, and the reliance on one's own body---its left and its right---as a means of 
									 beginning to orient. Therefore, orientation is not simply about the objects in a space (like the relation of the chair to the door) but about the relationship of the 
									 body to that space. We use our body's relationship with space and objects to navigate. Ahmed argues, though, that knowing left from right does not necessarily mean 
									 we can orient to where we are going---we can still be lost, physically and/or mentally. Heiddegger states that orientation is less about the sides of the body and more about the 
									 familiarity with the world (pg. 6-7). To use a wall to navigate a dark room means knowing what a wall represents. 
									 Ahmed discusses how we may become familiar with unfamiliar places due to our familiarity with social norms; "'getting lost' takes us somewhere ... being lost can in its turn become a 
									 familiar feeling" (pg. 7). <br><br>

									 The body is our starting point, from which we begin orientation. This also refers to the "where" of the body, "bodily dwelling" which "takes the body outside itself, as it is affected 
									 and shaped by its surroundings" (pg. 8-9). She writes: "spaces are not exterior to bodies; instead, spaces are like a swcond skin that infolds in the folds 
									 of the body" (pg. 9). If space itself is oriented,  "then what appears depends on one's point of view" (pg. 12). In discussing geospaciality, orientation is different from location---where orientation 
									 is relative space, location is absolute and fixed. <br><br>

									 She discusses the politic of orientation when describing the body, specifically the weighting of the right (as in right brain) over the left, where the left is 
									 seen as "weak and worthless" and most associated with women and racial minorities (pg. 13). In terms of political affiliation, the right is often viewed as 
									 reasonable, normal, and straightforward. "The right becomes the straight line, and the left becomes the origin of deviation" (pg. 14). Similarly, the east is posited as exotic, 
									 "oriental," "behind" the West, while the West is viewed as normal, forward, and civilized. She also discusses the social orientation of "being in line" (or falling in line) with others, 
									 orienting towards some social norm or culture. She also describes the lines of disciplines, often in philosophy paternalistically from one "father" to another. Disciplines take on a specific perspective 
									 of the world, through what is valued in the discipline, which also "mark out those who are 'out of line'" (pg. 22). In terms of sexual orientation, Ahmed posits that a heterosexual orientation means turning "towards the objects that are given to us by heterosexual culture, 
									 but also ... '[turning] away' from sobjects that take us off this line" (pg. 21). We "turn" or redirect our behavior and responses when interacting with other people or objects. 
									 Socially, geospacially, and politically, "the body gets directed in some ways more than others" (pg. 15).
									 <br><br>

									 <h3>Chapter 1: Orientations Towards Objects</h3>

									 Structure of chapter is going through different phenemological philosophers, particularly Heiddegger, Husserl, and Marx and how each would interpret the lived experience and interfacing with the table. <br><br>

									 Husserl: Every moment you perceive the table is constantly changing. As you move around the table, your sensory perception is always in flux and changing and you can never experience the same experience twice. Your perception of the table is unstable, while the real table remains the same.<br><br>

									 Husserl's Bracketing: The act of seeing is this act of filtering out everything you are not attending to. The act of ignoring things. Her main focus was on visual senses. <br><br>

									 Heiddegger: The moment of non-use is the moment of which the object is attributed as having properties. When using a hammer, you aren't thinking about its properties - like it being metal - but when you cannot use it, you think about it's properties, like it's inability to be used for being too heavy. This is useful for thinking about foregrounding and backgrounding. How do we interpret the hammer when we are or are not using it?<br><br>

									 Marx: The table has all of this embedded cultural history. In order for the table to get there, labor and commodification shape it. This history is often forgetten when perceiving the table. 

									 <br><br>

									 <h3>Chapter 2: Sexual Orientation</h3>
									 
									 Ahmed's reading of Merleau-Pony's Phenomenology of Perception is that queer moments happen, through angles other than "'the right way up'" (pg. 65). Yet as the body adjusts, the world becomes vertical again; subjects "'straighten'" the queer effects. Here, she argues that the straightening of space is directly 
									 relevant to the body, and slantwise space must be overcome for the body to be able to do things. She discusses how the tracing of lines, like on tracing paper, which obscure the lines that came before it, act as normative lines. Thus, the vertical body, shaped by the repetition of bodily and social action 
									 which requires its uprightness, is a normative one. She states that when something is "out of line" it does not only appear oblique but shapes the perspective of the world itself. <br><br>

									 She addresses the etymology of the word queer, in its use as a sexual orientation. Coming from the Indo-European word "twist," queerness is a spatial term which was translated into a sexual term, to describe a twisted and crooked sexuality. 
									 Orientation, though seen as a medical and scientific word, is merely a "metaphor drawn from magnetism and navigation" (pg. 69). 
									 Sexual orientation, as a term, replaced previous directional metaphors: deviant, pervert, invert, bent. She discusses how the spatiality of the term queer maps to how bodies inhabit 
									 sexual spaces and how bodies are sexualized through how they inhabit spaces. This chapter focuses not on the orientation of lived experience, but on the orientation in sexual orientation as a concept - how one orientates oneself sexually towards some and not others. <br><br>

									 She discusses how sexual orientation insinuates "having" an orientation, in that your sexual interests are "directed" towards specific others. A two sex model shapes a binary orientation, where the two possible orientations become 
									 straight or queer - queer meaning all nonstraight and nonnormative identities. Yet the importance of sexuality has become a relatively recent phenomenon, where the idea of "a" homosexual is rather moden (see Foucault, Weeks). Sexual orientation as a concept is unbalanced, and was not designed to place 
									 heterosexual and homosexual as equals. Homosexuals were the ones who were seen as "having" an orientation, while the heterosexual is of a neutral position. 
									 
									 <br><br>Thus, the homosexual orientates in deviance away from heterosexuality. The heterosexual orientates towards "the other sex," following the straight line Ahmed has used as a metaphor throughout. In doing so, straightness also becomes attached to other values: decency, conventionality, directness, honesty. The normative view of heterosexuality presumes a straight line that leads each binary sex to its opposite: a man would desire a woman and vice versa. 
									 Here is some familiar discourse: "The bodies of each sex are 'directed' toward the other, as if by design" (pg. 71). The literal shape that heterosexual genitals are presumed to take are "designed" for heterosexuality. To go off line is to turn away from the "other" sex and run towards the "same" sex. Further, same-sex desire is often read as 
									 an inversion of heterosexuality in that, for example, if a woman is "really a man" then she must be attracted towards the sex that she is not, the feminine woman. Even while queer desire is viewed as "off line," it is brought back onto "straight lines" through normative reading.<br><br>

									 Psychoanalysts like Freud have attempted to "backtrace" homosexuality to its source; what makes the current homosexual become a homosexual? Freud argued that this backwards view presents a continuous chain of events, a linear presentation to be analyzed for what caused 
									 deviant sexuality. Homosexuality has often been seen as walking away from familial love, while family love becomes "an ideal that can only be 'returned' by heterosexual love" (pg. 73). In psychoanalytic terms, Ahmed argued that "homosexuality challenges the 'ego ideal' of the family" (pg. 73). To be loyal to the family, 
									 one identifies one's own ego ideal with the family. The family, associated with the body of the father, and the wish for his love, "becomes an allegiance to the form of the family in the sense of the desire to continue its 'line'" (pg. 73). To be in line with the heterosexual family, one must "direct one's desires toward marriage and reproduction ... the reproduction of the family line" (pg. 74). 
									 This orientation - the orienation of opposite sexes towards one another - further constructs women's bodies as made for men, a tool for which the man extends himself.<br><br>

									 She also explores straightness not as a sense of being, but a sense of becoming. She pushes back against the two narratives of choice or biological determinism when discussing sexuality. A constructivist view does not necessitate choice, and it also does not explain how sexuality can be felt as inherent, bodily, and essential. Ahmed proposes a need 
									 to understand sexuality as both effects and as intrinstic and natural. In considering heterosexuality as a compulsory sexuality, we can view the set of institutional and social practices that require individuals to be heterosexual. "The fantasy of a natural orientation is an orientation device 
									 that organizes worlds around the form of the heterosexual couple, as if it were from this 'point' that the world unfolds" (pg. 85). As theorized by Butler, heteronormativity, the background that is compulsory heterosexuality, demands that the loss of queer love, through becoming straight, is not grieved. This is because queer love (queer objects of romance) are not determined close enough 
									 to the heterosexual family line to be grieved. The repetitive actions of compulsory heterosexuality shape the body so that it can only be heterosexual, restricting the capacity for other ways of being. "The queer child can only ... be read as a source of injury: a sign of failure to repay the debt of life by becoming straight" (pg. 91). <br><br>
									 
									 Ahmed discusses Freud's psychoanalysis once again, focusing specifically on the "contingent invert," which he cast as a subject who turns to homosexuality after failed heterosexuality (e.g., the lesbian who can't get a man, prison sex). Compulsory heterosexuality, as a blockade, may be avoided through contact with other queers. When pulled by one's desire, one might come into contact with other objects off the vertical line. This is referred to as "contact sexuality," which is also often used 
									 to deem certain orientations as less real. However, she also argues that heterosexuality is a "contact sexuality" in that  it is shaped through social and familial interactions. She offers interesting commentary on two ways lesbians are explained and justified in the heterosexual gaze: as sisters (being the same) or as men (the butch, the stand-in for the husband). The first is similar to the idea of the "lesbian merger" - that women who desire women are the same, and lose any sense of difference, which is predicated on women, generally, being the same. Without men, women merge into one entity. 
									 This opens the door to arguments of heterosexuality's ethical desirability for difference, being "open" to the difference in a partner. <br><br>

									 <h3>Chapter 3: The Orient and Other Cultures</h3>

									 Starts chapter with Franz Fanon who focuses on how Black bodies are placed in the world, and how objectified Black bodies are in the white world when attempting to move and interact with objects. 
									 Black bodies are limited in what they can do and reach by white supremacy. People of racialized bodies are disoriented  through racism, which diminished the capacity for action. "Phenomonology helps us to show how race is an effect of 
									 racialization, and to investigate how the invention of race as if it were 'in' bodies shape what bodies 'can do'" (pg. 112). <br><br>

									 She discusses orientalism, as in "the orient" that is associated with the "east." She argues that the Orient is constructed as an other, where the Occident (the west) is the default orientation. Othering the Orient has put it within reach of commodification from the West, placing it also as a space to do things you do not do in "proper" societies. 
									 East is constructed as a fixed place of otherness, rather than as a direction or an orientation. <br><br>

									 There is also to be orientated towards something, but to be orientated around something, which is not taking up that thing but to be taken up by something, such that you may even become what it is that is around. We are constantly orientated around heterosexuality, whiteness, Western-ness. <br><br>

									 She discusses talking about having a shared orientation towards objects. For example, in print, while everyone reads the same thing does not mean everyone has the same interpretation, same reading, same worldviews; we may face the same object which bind us through lines, yet we may not have the same cohesive view. Objects become objects through the repetition of turning towards them. 

									 <h3>Conclusion: Disorientation and Queer Subjects</h3>

									 Ahmed focuses here on disorientation, asking what moments of disorientation can tell us and how queer politicsl might involve disorientation ("without legislating disorientation as a politics") (pg. 158). 
									 Disorientation can be ordinary and conservative, as well. She posits that it is not about simply experiencing disorientation, as well all do, but how disorientation 
									 impacts bodies and spaces, how they are shaped and directed. She states: "disorientation involves becoming an object" (pg. 159). This perspective encapsulates Fanon's 
									 theorizations of the Black body as object; how some bodies are more often disoriented, or called to crisis, than other bodies (pg. 159). She describes how non-white bodies are often "stopped," not 
									 simply physically altering a path or available path, but shaping what one's relationship to moving. Similarly, "being out of place" can disorient others; when a non-normative body moves through a 
									 normative space, it may disorient that normativity of that space (pg. 160). <br><br>

									 This final chapter focuses on the relationship between queer and the disorientation of objects. Ahmed uses queer in two ways: (1) as a concept that is non-normative, as disorientating; 
									 and (2) as non-normative sexual practices. She discusses how heteronormativity reproduces more than itself, but also culture and attributes. Michael Moon's concept of sexual 
									 disorientation says that sexual disorientation---the queerness of some bodies coming into contact with others---becomes social disorientation, disrupting how things are arranged (pg. 162). 
									 Distance is approximate only to orientation. For example, distance represents the "slipping away" of something reachable but threatens to become out of reach (pg. 166). There is thus 
									 disorientation in the loss of an object that was once proximate.<br><br>

									 She describes the history of objects as extensions of our social bodies. Objects like pens and doorknobs have come to be through the historical affordances of needing such objects. They become "historical" because 
									 they become ordinary, but re-encountering objects as if new or strange refuses to make them part of history (pg. 164). Attending to objects like furniture, which shape our relationships to objects and meanings, Ahmed describes how 
									 the commodification of furniture conventions also arrange our lives in certain ways (pg. 168). Furniture orients us to specific inhabitations. She makes the case that 
									 furniture which does not blend in the background, or makes us uncomfortable, may be queer furniture. She states that "queer objects support proximity between those who are supposed to live on parallel lines, 
									 as points that should not meet" - such as two men, or a Black and a white body (pg. 169). Queer objects support treading a different path when we are disoriented from losing our ground. The "queer table" offers support when queers find support; the queer "does not reside in a body or 
									 an object, and is dependent on the mutuality of support" (pg. 170). <br><br>

									 Beyond positioning queerness as wholly about sexual orientation, Ahmed writes about queer as a political orientation. In some cases, the "straight lines" of homonormative queers 
									 loses sight of how heterosexuality shapes lines: "It is possible to live on an oblique angle, and follow straight lines" (pg. 172). Homonormativity not only does not contest heteronormativity, but it 
									 upholds it. She describes this form of assumiliation as "a politics of following the straight line even as a deviant body" (pg. 173). Homonormativity follows straight lines in hopes of 
									 accumulating "points" in a heternormative world. Adopting specific queer identities into a heteronormative institution simply extends the straight line, but 
									 continues to other those who do not fit on this longer straight line. Lee Edelman uses "reproductive futurism" to describe the authentication of a heterosexual social 
									 order "by speaking the name of a future as an inheritance that we did not receive: we would try and be as straight as we could be, as if we could convert what we did not receive 
									 into a posession" (pg. 173). <br><br>

									 Once more, I see <a href="visible-identities.html">Alcoff's summary of identity to liberal and left politics here.</a> Bawer argues that queers should want a seat at the larger table, rather than their own 
									 tiny tables, stating the only draw to the tiny table us prejudice and liberation from anti-queer prejudice would draw him to the big table (pg. 173). Society is the big table, and the victimization of minorities are represented in 
									 the divisive little tables. Ahmed argues that "the desire to join [the big family table] is a desire to inhabit the very 'place' of [queer] rejection" (pg. 174). Constrasting the following of the straight line, Ahmed also believes deviation, 
									 for the sake of deviation, is not necessarily progressive, but creating its own straight line, perhaps towards queer shame. <br><br>

									 I enjoy her breakdown of the term "out" and how being out is oriented around whiteness, making being out for queers of colors difficult to impossible. Similarly, being out is not 
									 always a choice, and sometimes ones body is enough to orient outness - like butch lesbians or non-conforming trans people. The closet as an orienting space allows specific moments of deviation 
									 are let out and which are kept in, "creating lines between public and private spaces" (pg. 175). "While the closet may seem a betrayal of queer (by containing what is queer at home) it 
									 is just as possible to be queer at home, or even to queer the closet. After all, closets still 'make room' or clear spaces, in which there are things left for bodies to do" (pg. 175-176). 

									 <br><br>How do we reconcile the straight line of homonormativity and the straightening line of compulsory queer deviation? Ahmed says disorientation politics should not make disorientation an obligation 
									 of queers, which both demands too much for some, but also forgives too much for others (homonormativity). She takes this position because it is not the responsibility of queers to 
									 do the disorienting work. A queer commitment would be "a commitment to opening up of what counts as a life worth living" (pg. 178). For example, embracing the "failure" to inheret the family line also 
									 opens the possibility of other ways of living. It still matters which lines we follow, given some lines accumulate privilege and others ruin, and some lines are unethical to follow. Yet for Ahmed, queer is not available as a 
									 line to follow, but rather a series of points which do not fit a line.
