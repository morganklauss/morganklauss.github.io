									<h2>The Whale and the Reactor</h2>
									
									Langdon Winner. 1986. The Whale and the Reactor: A Search for Limits in an Age of High Technology. University of Chicago Press.
									<br><br>

									<h3>Preface</h3>
									This book is an examination of technology from the perspective of social and political action. He outlines it explicitly as a critique, also purposefully pointing out that critiques of technology have not been understood as having the positive intent they are meant to carry, being labelled as "anti-technology." His major question is in searching for the limits of technology, where we will decide to draw the line.

									<h3>Part I: A Philosophy of Technology</h3>

									<h4>Chapter 1: Technologies as Forms of Life</h4>

									Winner begins his critique by noting the lack of engagement with any philosophy of technology or the basic issues of technology being well-defined, despite booming interest in it. He writes that there is, as of 1986, no philosophy of technology. He states that "despite the fact that nobody would deny its importance to an adequate understanding of the human condition, technology has never joined epistemology, metaphysics, esthetics, law, science, and politics as a fully respectable topic for philosophical inquiry" (pg. 4). A philosophy of technology is meant to critically examine the nature and significance of technology to humans. He further criticizes 
									engineers for seeming "unaware of any philosophical questions their work might entail" (pg. 4). <br><br>

									He posits the idea of "progress" as holding back a philosophy of technology, where society has adopted an "unflinching confidence" in technological development for the human benefit. The general, taken-for-granted approach to technology has been a focus on use. Winner argues this is accompanied by "a range of moral context" such as tools being used well, poorly, for good, or good bad (pg. 6). He argues that the "promiscuous utility" or technologies has led to them being regarded as fundamentally neutral. Yet, human history has shown that technologies are not simply tools, but can reshape human society and behaviors.  
									
									He describes how social science has tried to "awaken the sleeper" of "technological somnambulism" through technology assessment, but this has 
									tended to view technology as the "cause" and everything else as the "effect" (pg. 10). He believes this ascribes a forceful adaptation onto humans, that their destiny is to adapt to 
									technological changes. He states that against the "empirical and moral shortcomings of cause-and-effect models" is the recognition of changes in human behaviors taking place /as/ technology is built. He states that these are 
									"new worlds being made" (pg. 11). He refers to technologies as "forms of life," not simply tools, but cultures that become "woven into the texture of everyday existence" (pg. 12). In some cases, technology has "added fundamentally new activities to the range of things human beings do" and has "begun to alter the very conditions of life itself" (pg. 13). His perspective follows Marxist materialism, in which our interactions with and changing of the shapes of material things also changes us.<br><br>

									However, he critiques both Marx and Wittgenstein, whom he has referenced throughout this chapter, as providing only passive philosophies for technological examination. Wittgenstein accepts forms of life as "a given," similar to 
									Winner's critique of technological somnambulism. Marx and Engels rejected influencing technological development, believing it to be inherently good and encouraged. Technological development 
									exists alongside and to encourage the inevitible shift from capitalism to socialism.<br><br>

									Winner questions: "As we 'make things work,' what kind of world are we making?" We must assess not only the tools, but "the production of psychological, social, and political conditions as a part of any 
									significant technical change" (pg. 17). <br><br>

									<h4>Chapter 2: Do Artifacts Have Politics?</h4>

									Winner opens the chapter discussing Lewis Mumford's two political technologies: the first authoritarian, system-centered, powerful but unstable; the second democratic, human-centered, weak but resourceful and durable (pg. 19). Interpreting technologies through political language is, despite the insistence 
									technologies are neutral, not new. They are often portrayed as great democratizers, enabling social justice and freedom. Even while technologies are interwoven into human life, including politics, the technologies themselves are viewed as 
									apolitical, and viewing them as political is positioned as ignoring the true source of value: humans. Consistently, discourse suggesting that artifacts have politics is met with criticism, which suggests that politics are only sourced from the social and/or economic system 
									a technology is embedded. While Winner finds this wise in terms of acknowledging the social systems engaged in technology, not simply cause-and-effects, he criticizes this view for acting as if 
									"technical things do not matter at all" (pg. 21).<br><br>

									Instead, he proposes a theory of technological politics that focuses on the characteristics of technologies and what they mean - as political phenomenon. He argues this does not replace the social deterministic model that suggests all values come from society, but compliments it. By politics, Winner is referring to relationships or 
									power and authority.<br><br>

									He highlights two ways artifacts contain politics: (1) Instances where a technology is used to settle an issue within a specific community; and (2) technologies that are most compatible with specific types of political relationships. 

									<br><br>

									1. In the first example, Winner discusses technologies built with a specific social intent in mind, in which those technologies often outlive their creators and continue shaping society 
									with that intent. These technologies "precede the use of the things in question" (pg. 25). In other words, oppression or authority or power are not simply effects of a neutrally designed technology, but specifically 
									designed and built to produce a specific set of consequences even before it is used by a human being. Further, a technology may have a general use (e.g., Moses' bridges for automobile access) but have other purposes beyond their immediate and general use (e.g., the bridges purposefully barring buses). 
									Technologies also do not need to be designed with a specific malicious intent in mind to be harmful (e.g., the technologies that are ignorantly designed to be inaccessible). Winner states that all technologies are designed 
									to favor some social interests over others. He argues that technologies are similar to legislation and public frameworks in that flexibility vanishes once commitments are made to a specific design.<br><br>

									2. In the second example, Winner discusses inherently political technologies, that some technologies could be, in their very nature, political. Certain technologies are so inflexible that choosing them is "to choose unalterably a particular form of political life" (pg. 29). Numerous theorists, from Engels to Plato, have discussed the 
									ultimate authority of certain technologies, like that of a ship. Running a ship requires authority, it is not a democratic process, and it necessitates people to act in specific ways. A ship is a technology that requires "central rule and decisive action" much like government (pg. 31). 
									He highlights two ways technologies can be viewed as inherently politics. (1) "The adoption of a given technical system actually requires the creation and maintenance of a particular set of social conditions as the operating environment for that system" (pg. 32). The technology can only exist given certain political circumstances also exist. (2) A weaker version of (1): A given technology is compatible with, but does not require, specific political circumstances. Some technologies accommodate some politics more than others, but other types of political structures 
									can still exist alongside them. Technologies that are inherently political require specific human behaviors, "the intractable properties of certain kinds of technology are strongly, perhaps unavoidably, linked to particular institutionalized patterms of power and authority" (pg. 38). The choices in designing something and deploying it solidify the type of impact it will have. And interventions by alternative social systems cannot alter the technology's political effects. <br><br>

									He states that both 1 and 2 can overlap and intersect - a technology can be flexible in some ways but rigid in others. He feels it is important to closely examine the politics of artifacts given how willful people are to change their behaviors and lives to accommodate new technologies, despite also resisting 
									such changes on purely political grounds. <br><br>

									<h4>Techne and Politeia</h4>

									Here, Winner argues that all technologies "must be scrutinized to see whether they are friendly or unfriendly to the idea of a just society" (pg. 40). He lays out Plato's considerations of politics as technology, "techne" as a type of strategic crafting of "politeaia," the order of human relationships within a state. In Plato's works, techne serves as a model for politics, but not vice versa; Winner states that since, techne has become politea, technologies shaping society and solely not vice versa. 
									He writes how the Industrial Revolution in the U.S. and Europe began competing with political insitutions for power, authority, and loyalty. Historically, philosophers like Plato have been concerned about the mixing of both civic virtue and materialism. Technical innovation should be approached with 
									caution because it is antithetical to civic virtue.<br><br>

									He contrasts this with the rise of republican political thought and capitalism, particularly in the United States, where self-interest and materialism began being posited as the key to civic virtue. Abundance and freedom 
									became equated values, and the drive to generate wealth welcomed new technologies as a blessing. At the time, material in the U.S. was viewed as so abundant that class conflict should not arise - there was enough to go around. New technologies were embraces as automatically 
									contributing to a good society. The key was in increasing efficiency, so that one society does not lag behind its global competitors.<br><br>

									He traces how industrial production led to specific insitutional patterns that have largely placed power and social control into large corporations, bureaucracies, and the military. More people began to work in huge technology-based institutions than ever before. Given the desire to do things in the most efficient and productive manner, humans began to operate in a bureaucratic manner that established highly structured relationships of command. 
									He calls the workplace "undisguisedly authoritarian" (pg. 48). He argues that as religious and traditional hierarchies crumbled, technology offered a way to restore hierarchy - a "godsend for inequality" (pg. 48). Large organizations now exercise power to control social and political interests that are meant to control them. A synthesis of social and political and technical phenomenon have influenced these societal shifts. <br><br>

									He argues that, unlike politics, "political wisdom ... [is], by and large, missing in those who design, engineer, and promote vast systems" (pg. 50). Instead reigns an obsession with the quest for profits, organizational control, and simply enjoying innovation, with no interest in how their work might shape the structure of society or justice. <br><br>
									
									He lists five concerns for which the public actually considers limiting technology. (1) It threatens health or safety; (2) It threatens to exhaust a vital resource; (3) It degrades the environment; (4) It threatens natural species and wilderness' (5) It causes "exaggerated" social stresses/strains. 
									While he feels these are worthwhile concerns, they "severely restrict the range of moral and political criteria that are permissible in public deliberations about 
									technological change" (pg. 51). He views the question of how "society can establish forms and limits for technological change" based on a desire for "a positively articulared idea of what society ought to be" as a challenge of utmost importance (pg. 52). 

									<br><br>He believes that if we establish technology as a political exercise, then we can identify each political commitment of that technology 
									to see the choices we must make about social and political life. The age of high technology must also ask "What is the best form of political society?" (pg. 52). "Because 
									technological innovation is inextricably linked to processes of social reconstruction, any society that hopes to control its own structural evolution must 
									confront each significant set of technological possibilities with scrupulous care" (pg. 54). 
									<br><br>

									<h3>Part II: Technology: Reform and Revolution</h3>

									<h4>Chapter 4: Building the Better Mousetrap</h4>

									The concepts of "appropriate," "intermediate," and "alternative" technologies were proposed in the 1960s as means for addressing the "issues" facing "Third World" countries. In the 1970s, such technologies were also proposed 
									as solutionist to the problems of industrialized societies. If the right kinds of technologies were used, society could be cured of its ills. In this chapter, Winner questions what makes a technology "appropriate" - for who and for what? Particularly, 
									in the cases of industrialized nations, it had seemed their culture and norm had led them to these social ills. So an appropriate technology would have to challenge these norms.<br><br>

									Winner points out that the rising number of institutes, businesses, governments, and researchers claiming to develop "appropriate" technology did not share a common ethos. Some viewed 
									appropriate technology as compatible with the capitalist system; others embraced a Marxist perspective. There arose ideology around "soft" (e.g., small energy inputs, ecologically sound, democratic, etc.) versus "hard" (e.g., high pollution rates, large energy input, destructive to cultures and species, etc.) technologies. 
									Winner argues these typologies were destined to fail because the necessary characteristics were not necessarily compatible within one system. <br><br>

									The obsession with New Age appropriate technology ended in 1980 with the election of Reagan, as all non-military economics moved back to the private sector. 
									<br><br>

									<h4>Chapter 5: Decentralization Clarified</h4>

									The notion of decentralization is to take enormous centralized insitutions and break them into smaller parts that are more accessible to democratic control. Calling for decentralization has been a consistent theme 
									among appropriate technologists and those disenchanted with the perceived destructiveness of sociotechnical organizations. Winner argues this term is vague and overly used. This chapter is dedicated to clarifying what decentralization means.<br><br>

									He breaks down the linguistics, which seem to be contrary. De- meaning undoing, -ization meaning becoming, central indicating some unspecified center. "Undoing the process of becoming central" (pg. 86). To centralize or decentralize something, one first 
									has to indicate the activity or behavior that is an issue, to locate the center of the problem. One has to determine how many centers there are, where they are located, how much power they possess, and their cultural diversity. The number of centers could be one or many, and deciding how many are the number to decenter depends on the issue. 
									The location of the center may be in one geographic place, many geographic places, or a social place (e.g., an influential figure). Then there is the problem of whether those places are accessible or not. Who has power shapes who and what has social, economic, and political control over de/centralization. Will decentralizing promote a diversity of culture or a vitality of a space? <br><br>

									Winner posits this as an interesting concept for technology, around issues of ownership, sources, conditions of production, distribution, and consumption, and use of goods and services. Technology companies, while they may not own or produce the majority of the world's or a country's specific technology or good, 
									are still often highly centralized within themselves. What economic and efficiency tradeoffs are people willing to make for decentralized technology companies?<br><br>

									Winner also argues that technologies themselves are centralized. The most commonly used everyday objects we do not know how to make, control, or repair. Many artifacts come from the same centers of production and distribution. Alongside technological "progress," 
									people find themselves reliant on centralized systems they have little power to influence. He states that "to decentralize technology would mean redesigning and replacing much of our existing hardware and reforming the ways our technologies are managed" (pg. 96).
