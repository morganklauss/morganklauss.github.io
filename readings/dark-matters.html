									<p style="font-size:1vw;">** indicates a chapter particularly salient / insightful to my research agenda</p>
									<br>

									<h3>Introduction, and Other Dark Matters</h3>

									<h4>Key Concepts</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>Epidermalization</b>: "the imposition of race on the body" (pg. 7).
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<b>Intersectional Paradigms</b>: "oppression cannot be reduced to one fundmental type, 
											and that oppressions work together in producing injustice" (Patricia Hill Collins on pg. 9).
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<b>Dark Matters</b>: Like blackholes in cosmology, "the often unvisible substance that in many ways structures the 
											universe of modernity" (Howard Winant on pg. 9). "The surveillence of blackness as often unperceivable 
											within the study of surveillence, all the while blackness being that nonnameable matter that matters the racialized 
											displinary society ... Blackness [is] a key site through which surveillence is praticed, narrated, and 
											enacted" (pg. 9).
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<b>Surveillence Studies</b>: "How and why populations are tracked, profiled, policed, and governed at 
											state borders, in cities, at airports, in ublic and private spaces, through biometrics, 
											telecommunications technology, CCTV, identification documents, and more recenty by way of 
											Internet-bases social network sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Also of focus are the ways 
											that those who are often subject to surveillance subvert, adopt, endorse, resist, innovate, limit, 
											comply with, and monitory that very surveillance" (pg. 13). There is no homogenous state of surveillance, 
											as surveillance may operate in discrete and nuanced ways, including contextually at specific "sites" (e.g., 
											the workplace, the military, or the marketplace). Markers of sites of surveillence may include:
										<ul>
											<li>
												<i>Rationalization</i>: "Reason, rather than tradition, emotion, or common-sense knowledge' is the justification given for standardization" (pg. 14)
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Technology use</i>
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Sorting</i>: of people into specific categories for management and privileging
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Knowledgeability</i>: Different levels of understanding of surveillence, and willingness to participate, affect 
												how surveillence is used
											</li>
											<li>
												<i>Urgency</i>: "where panic prevails in risk and threat assessments, and in the adoption of security measures, 
												especially post-9/11" (pg. 14).
											</li>
										</ul><br>
										<li>
											Gary T. Marx argues new technologies and practices of surveillance...
											<ul>
												<li>
													Are no longer impeded by physical distance.
												</li>
												<li>
													Allow data to be easily shared, stores, compressed, and aggregated.
												</li>
												<li>
													Is often undetectable, either by being disguised (e.g., undercover agents) or by being digital.
												</li>
												<li>
													Is often done without consent, or knowledge, of the target.
												</li>
												<li>
													Is about preventing or mitigating risk through prediction.
												</li>
												<li>
													Is now less labor intensive, making it easier to expand monitoring.
												</li>
												<li>
													Is not only wearable, through devices like fitness trackers, but relies on people tracking themselves.
												</li>
												<li>
													Guilt is presumed based on someone's categorical assignment.
												</li>
												<li>
													Is bodily invasive.
												</li>
												<li>
													It's intense and difficult to avoid, making uncertainty over being surveilled a strategic characteristic of
													 surveillance.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
											<b>Panoptic Sort</b>: "The processes by which collection of data ... is used to identify, classify, assess, 
											sort, or otherwise" control and define life (pg. 16). 
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<b>Surveillance Assemblage</b>: "Sees the observed human body 'broken down by 
											being abstracted from its territorial setting' and then reassembled elsewhere (a 
											crediting reporting database, for example) to serve as virtual 'data doubles' and also as 
											sites of comparison" (pg. 16).
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<b>Racializing Surveillance</b>: "A technology of social control where surveillance practices, policies, and performances 
												concern the production of norms pertaining to race ... [signaling] those moments when surveillance 
												reify boundaries, borders, and bodies along racial lines, and where the outcome is often 
												discriminatory treatment of those who are negatively racialized by such surveillance ... [It] is not static 
												or only applied to particular human groupings, but it does rely on certain techniques in order to 
												reify boundaries along racial lines, and, in so doing, it refies race" (pg. 16-17). 
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
											<b>Sousveillence</b>: Veillence, being a neutral form of watching. If surveillance is the watching of people by 
											entities in positions of power, than sousveillance is its oppositional inversation of power relations. "'Observing and recording by an entity 
											not in a position of power or authority over the subject of the veillence'" (e.g., recording police 
											brutality) (pg. 19).

										<br>
										<li>
											<b>
											Dark Sousveillance</b>: "The tactics employed to render one's self out of sight ... an imaginative place 
											from which to movilize a critique of racializing surveillance, a critique that takes form in antisurveillance, 
											countersurveillance, and other freedom practices" (pg 21). "How certain surveillance technologies installed 
											during slavery to monitor and track blackness as a property  ... anticipate the contemporary surveillance of 
											racialized subjects, and ... how the contemporary surveillance of the racial body might be contended with" (pg. 24).

									<h3>Chapter 1 | Notes on Surveillance Studies: Through the Door of No Return</h3>

									This chapter rethinks the surveillance prison, The Panopticon (1786), theorized by 18th century English philosopher 
									Jeremy Bentham through the layout of the slave ship, Brooks (1789). 
									<br><br>

									<h4>The Panopticon</h4>

									Originally imagined as a model for workplace supervision, the Panopticon was imagined as an all-seeing architectural design with 
									many functions - prisons, but also schools, factories, etc. Intended to be "control by design" (pg. 34), 
									Benthall designed a systems of circular cells surrounding a central watchtower. Prisoners would be watched from inside, 
									from the tower, or from outside, through the windows at the back of each cell, but they would not see or communicate with 
									one another. At night, mirrors would reflect lamplight so that prisoners would be unable to see if there was a guard 
									in the tower. The intention was to enact a covert power over prisoners, where they, unable to 
									tell whether they were actually being watched at any given time, would self-discipline. 
									<br><br>
									Other conceptions of surveillance inspired by the Panopticon:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Synopticon (Mathiesen, 1997): "A reversal ... where the many watch the few in a mass mediated-fashion" (pg. 38).
										</li>
										<li>
											Banopticon (Bigo): Where certain groups are labelled as dangerous to the state, and security measures are 
											predicated on that risk (pg. 38-39).
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									Some surveillance scholars no longer view panopticonism as useful in the digital age, arguing that 
									"'post-Panoptical subjects reliably watch over themselves' without need of the physical structure of the 
									Panopticon" (pg. 39). Some argue that the culture of social media makes people seek out being watched, thus 
									disciplining themselves by giving endless amounts of data to others, companies, and governments.
