									<h2>Visible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self</h2>
									
									Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff. 2006. Visible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self. Oxford University Press. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/0195137345.001.0001" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/0195137345.001.0001</a>
									<br><br>
									** indicates a chapter particularly salient / insightful to my research agenda
									<br>

									<h3>...</h3>

									<h4>Introduction: Identity and Visibility</h4>
									
									This book theorizes the ontological reality of identity. Alcoff argues: "The reality of identities often comes from the fact 
									they are visibly marked on the body itself, guiding if not determining the way we perceive and judge others and are 
									perceived and judged by them" (pg. 5). Alcoff's goal "is to cast serious doubt on [the] suspicion of difference," for 
									ignoring difference reifies interpersonal and structural distrust and discrimination. She argues that race and gender are 
									not peripheral, but fundamental to one's self. In particular, gender and race are visible in ways that 
									age, class, and sometimes sexuality are not. She discusses how gender is often viewed as determinate through the 
									visuality of genitals, and race, even when ambiguous, always has some biometric marker of the "truth." She 
									portrays this in the example of a white man divorcing his wife under the grounds he had tricked him into thinking she 
									was white. She was asked to bear her breasts to the jury to determine her race (pg. 7) - which is also reminiscent of 
									trans panic.<br><br>
									
									Class works alongside and is 
									determined by visible markers of social identities, like race and gender. "Capitalism was a racial and gender system from its inception, distributing roles and resources according to 
									identity markers of status and social position and thus reenforcing their stability" (pg. viii). Alcoff discusses how resistance to "identity politics" in 
									the United States, questioning the relation of identity to politics, has spread from the "'progressive' academic community ... to the divisions that keep 
									us from moving forward" (pg. x). Class solidarity is encumbered by divisive race and gender relations and undermined antiracist and 
									feminist work. Alcoff argues that, while visible identity may be "a means of segregating and oppressing human groups," it is also "the 
									means of manifesting unity and resistance" (pg. 7).

									<h4>The Pathologizing of Identity</h4>

									Criticisms of identity or "identity politics" sugges that "separatism, particularism, and narrow group interest," but 
									these criticisms ignore the ways "identities figure into political discourses and practices" (pg. 12). Often, the discussion of oppression of 
									certain genders or races is viewed as "bashing" of the dominant group, even when that group is not mentioned (pg. 14). Alcoff argues that identity is an 
									"a priori problem," which exists independent of experience. In particular, she argues that social identities "post dangers 
									and commit one to mistake assumptions when they are believed to be real and/or acted upon politically" when they are "overly 
									homogenizing, essentialist, reductive, or simplistic constructions" (pg. 14). <br><br>

									Alcoff seeks to answer the question as to how identity politics have become to be seen as divisive and dangerous. She starts by analyzing 
									Arthur Schlesinger's 1991 book, "The Disuniting of America," which posited identity difference as a threat to an 
									idealized goal of homogenity and postracism (pg. 16). Specifically, Schlesinger believed whites "have given up their 
									European identities out of rational and progressive motivations, but that nonwhites are now refusing to follow suit" (pg. 17). 
									While arguing we must leave ethnic identity behind, he also proposes European thought and culture as superior and thus, to eliminate identity, all 
									others must assimilate. Alcoff argues the true danger is identity movements, which have been built on histories of 
									oppression, being perceived as "a threat to progressive politics" (pg. 18). She argues that the true challenge of identity politics is 
									"conceptualizing justice across cultural difference" while "relat[ing] precisely to class" (pg. 19).
