									<h2>Data Feminism</h2>
									D'Ignazio C. & Klein L. F. (2020). Data feminism. MIT Press
									<br><br>

									<h3>5. Unicorns, Janitors, Ninjas, Wizards, and Rock Stars</h3>

									"Principle #5 of Data Feminism is to Embrace Pluralism. Data feminism insists that the most complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives, with priority given to local, Indigenous, and experiential ways of knowing."
									<br><br>

									The chapter opens with a discussion of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP) in San Fran. Its mapping projects happen in collaboration with 
									nonprofits and community-based orgs. The authors describe how some of the AEMP maps are designed to make patterns easily visible, while other maps 
									purposefully go against "best" practices in visualization by occluding the geography of the city. Instead, red bubbles representing evictions obscure 
									San Fran, while blue bubbles showcase oral stories of evicted residents when clicked. The authors write: "the Narratives map enacts dissent from San Francisco city policies in the same way that it enacts dissent from the conventions of information design.
									It refuses both the clarity and cleanliness associated with the best practices of data visualization and the homogenizing and “cleanliness” associated with the forces of gentrification that lead to evictions in the first place."
									<br><br>

									The authors argue that the AEMP project exemplifies the fifth principle of the book, embrace pluralism. They define it as so:
									"valuing many perspectives and voices and doing so at all stages of the process—from collection to cleaning to analysis to communication. It also means attending to the ways in which data science methods can inadvertently work to suppress those voices in the service of clarity, cleanliness, and control. Many of our received ideas about data science work against pluralistic meaning-making processes, and one goal of data feminism is to change that."
									<br><br>

									They critique the common sentiment of desiring "clean" and organized data in data science: "But what might be lost in the process of dominating and disciplining data? Whose perspectives might be lost in that process? And, conversely, whose perspectives might be additionally imposed? The ideas expressed by Wickham, and by the press, carry the assumption that all data scientists, in all contexts, value cleanliness and control over messiness and complexity. But as the example of the AEMP demonstrates, these are not the requirements, nor the goals, of all data projects." 
									They tie the ideal of "cleaninliness" to eugenics in the 19th century, the source of modern statistics. They describe how cleaning can function as a "diversity-hiding trick."
									They state how cleaning can be destructive rather than constructive, erasing the roots of "data settings" which the data are situated in when collected. They describe how those removed from the context of collection become strangers in the dataset, third parties who are multiple levels removed from the data context. 
									They describe how this can be cause "epistemic violence—the harm that dominant groups like colonial powers wreak by privileging their ways of knowing over local and Indigenous ways."
								
									<br><br>

									"So here’s an ethical quandary: Does one choose cleaner data at a larger scale that is relatively easy and quick to purchase? Or more accurate data at a local scale for which one has to engage and build trust with community groups?"
									<br><br>

									"embracing pluralism, as this concept is often described today, does not mean that everything is relative, nor does it mean that all truth claims have equal weight. And it most certainly does not mean that feminists do not believe in science. It simply means that when people make knowledge, they do so from a particular standpoint: from a situated, embodied location in the world. More than that, by pooling our standpoints—or positionalities—together, we can arrive at a richer and more robust understanding of the world."
									<br><br>

									<b>The concept of co-liberation in data science</b>: "By contrast, a model that positions co-liberation as the end goal leads to a very specific set of processes and practices, as well as criteria for success. Co-liberation is grounded in the belief that enduring and asymmetrical power relations among social groups serve as the root cause of many societal problems. Rather than framing acts of technical service as benevolence or charity, the goal of co-liberation requires that those technical workers acknowledge that they are engaged in a struggle for their own liberation as well, even and especially when they are members of dominant groups."
									<br><br>

									<b>Takeaway:</b>
									"Embracing pluralism is a feminist strategy for mitigating this risk. It allows both time and space for a range of participants to contribute their knowledge to a data project and to do so at all stages of that project. In contrast to an underspecified data for good model, embracing pluralism offers a way to work toward a model of data for co-liberation. This means transferring knowledge from experts to communities and explicitly cultivating community solidarity in data work, as we see in the case of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project. Moreover, embracing pluralism is not incompatible with “bigness” or scale; the EJ Atlas shows how pluralistic processes can be used to assemble a global archive and support empirical work in the service of justice. A single data scientist wizard will never defeat the matrix of domination alone, no matter how powerful their spells might be. But a well-designed, data-driven, participatory process, one that centers the standpoints of those most marginalized, empowers project participants, and builds new relationships across lines of social difference—well, that might just have a chance."
