									<h2>Post-userism</h2>
									
									Eric P. S. Baumer and Jed R. Brubaker. 2017. Post-userism. In Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '17). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 6291–6303. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025740
									<br><br>

									This paper examines the construct of HCI's "user" and what that construct both highlights and conceals. Their concept of post-userism exposes the limits of the user as a substitute for "human" and proposes alternatives.<br><br>

									They argue that, given the "user's" centrality to HCI, design has cast any actor as a "user" - what they call "user-ifying." It has become an ideology which transforms "people  into  representations  within  our systems,  interfaces,  design  practices,  and  discourse" (pg. 6291). 
									The user represents a specific subject position in relation to technology, a rhetorical device that is used to differentiate HCI from computer science and other fields. 
									HCI's relationship with the "user" is double-edged: one one hand, centering a user can be empowering, but on the other, it has the 
									potential to dehumanize. Further, the "user" tends to ignore other subject positions; people who are accessing technology through an intermediary, or those using throw away accounts.
									 <br><br>
									 
									 The authors argue that the user is a modernist concept, which embraces efficiency, calculability, and predictability, one which was particularly salient during the "first wave" of HCI (e.g., Fitt's Law, quantitative metrics of performance, etc.). They posit post-userism as a post-modernist approach for HCI. <br><br>

									 <h3>The Human in Waves of HCI</h3>
									 The authors explore different questions of HCI: (1) What is human? (2) What is computer? (3) What is interaction?<br><br>

									 <h4>First Wave</h4>
									 An information processing loop between user and computer. <br><br>

									<b>Human</b>: "a  rational  actor  trying  to  optimize performance (increase speed, reduce errors, etc.)" (pg. 6293). 
									<br><br>

									<b>Computer</b>: "an  information  processing  device to enable that rational actor to perform its task" (pg. 6293).
									<br><br>

									<b>Interaction</b>: "an  information  exchange  between human and computer" (pg. 6293). 
									<br><br>

									<h4>Second Wave</h4>
									A situational actor who interacts with software with the goal of performing work-related tasks relevant to their organizational context. <br><br>

									<b>Human</b>: "a  situated  actor  (often  a  member  of  an organization)  trying  to  accomplish  a  task  within  a particular  organizational  context,  often  as  part  of  a group  of  other  people  who  may  be  members  of  the same or different organizations" (pg. 6293). 
									<br><br>

									<b>Computer</b>: "a  software  application  used  in  the conduct  of  work  (calendar,  spreadsheet,  word processor, etc.)" (pg. 6293). 
									<br><br>

									<b>Interaction</b>: "using software to accomplish a goal, often related to the individual’s work context" (pg. 9293). 
									<br><br>

									<h4>Third Wave</h4>
									A person using technology to engage in socio-cultural practices, rather than simply work, and can exist beyond the desktop computer. Interactions can involve multiple people and devices: "one device (e.g., me and my smartphone), multiple users at one  device  (e.g.,  large  shared  displays),  one  user  with multiple  devices  (e.g.,  how  I  manage  data  across  my smartphone,  tablet,  laptop,  and  server),  and  multiple  users with  multiple  devices  (e.g.,  almost  any  kind  of  ubicomp system)" (pg. 6294). <br><br>

									<b>Human</b>: "a  person  engaging  in  (a  set  of)  socio-cultural  practices  embedded  within  a  numerous broader  contexts,  including  cultural,  historical, political, organizational, etc." (pg. 6293). 
									<br><br>

									<b>Computer</b>: "a  technological  system  that  may consist of a single device, a constellation of devices, an infrastructure, or a more complex assemblage that arises  from  and  is  embedded  within  a  particular  set of contexts" (pg. 6293). 
									<br><br>

									<b>Interaction</b>: "the  experience  [31,91]  of leveraging a technological system in the course of an individually,  socially,  or  culturally  meaningful practice" (pg. 6293). 
									<br><br>

									<h3>Levels of Representation</h3>
									They present how subject representation can be grouped into four levels.<br><br>

									<b>Systems Level</b>: 
									The types of interaction that lay below the interface but still shape relationships (e.g., variables, data structures, schemas). Of interest to HCI are relationships that impact the "user" directly (e.g., authentication, input, accounts, user data).<br><br>

									<b>Interface Level</b>: What individuals see and interact with, how entities and their relationships are presented to "users."
									<br><br>

									<b>Design Process Level</b>: Who and what is represented during the design process and how. How "users" and their experiences are typified, through methods like 
									personas, scenarios, stakeholder interviews, etc. <br><br>

									<b>Ideological Level</b>: Discourse within a field of study or discipline. The most common in "user" discussions, representing how people discuss "user" needs, qualities, and experiences. This occurs when the term user collapses system, interface, and design levels with lived experiences. "The  most  common  ideological representation in HCI can be seen when we equate 'person' with 'user'" (pg. 6295). <br><br>

									<h3>What is Post-Userism?</h3>
									"Post-userism  involves  attending  to  representations  of  the ecologies  of  subject  positions  that  people  might  occupy with respect to technology. Researchers, designers, systems architects,  etc.  could  benefit  from  post-userism when  they encounter  breakdowns  across  the  four  levels  of representation  described  above.  As  a  practical  strategy, post-userism  does  not  necessarily  help  solve  existing problems.  Rather,  it  enables  more comprehensive  problem setting or problem framing [28,77,78], facilitating a design scope  that  encompasses  greater  varieties  of  human-computer interactions" (pg. 6295). 
									<br><br>
									Post-userism might lead us to: (1) Examine under-accounted for relationships in HCI, like those of intermediary technology users; and (2) Explore what HCI looks like in the absence of a traditional user, focusing instead on relational practices.
