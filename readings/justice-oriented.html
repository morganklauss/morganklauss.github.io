									<h2>Social Justice-Oriented Interaction Design: Outlining Key Design Strategies and Commitments.</h2>

									Lynn Dombrowski, Ellie Harmon, and Sarah Fox. 2016. Social Justice-Oriented Interaction Design: Outlining Key Design Strategies and Commitments. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS '16). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 656–671. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/2901790.2901861

									<br><br>

									This paper proposes design approaches for large-scale social issues, which they call Social Justice-Oriented Interaction Design. They highlight that scale, scope, complexity, and politics make large-scale social issues difficult to tackle. 
									This includes researchers and designers potentially needing to work with or against state and personal level politics. 
									They offer approaches to six social justice goals - ransformation, recognition, reciprocity, enablement, distribution, and accountability- and outline three commitments for attaining these goals - a commitment to conflict, a commitment to reflexivity, and a commitment to personal ethics and politics. 
									They argue that these approaches and commitments help guard against the tendency for design to other/marginalize and privilege elites. They describe a social justice approach as 
									"attending to the ways that individuals experience oppression, including how benefits, burdens, obligations, power, opportunity, and privilege have been (in)equitably distributed within society" (pg. 657). 
									<br><br>

									<h3>Social Justice</h3>

									The authors offer a short history of "social justice" as a term to ground their approach. Philosophers like Rawls have adopted the term to refer to attempts to "benefits and burdens of a social system such that they are fair or equitably shared" (pg. 657). Given Rawls has been criticized with his lack of engagement with race in 
									his theories on social justice, the authors highlight that social justice is evidently not a singular concept but as an evolving mechanism for thinking about power. Acknowledging the complexity of social justice, 
									the authors situate their approach under H.P.P. Lötter's definition of multiple, contagious aspects of justice. He puts forth the six dimensions of justice the authors utilize in their orientation to design: ecognition,  reciprocity,  enablement,  distribution, accountability, and transformation.
									The authors state that "social justice explicitly takes into account how historicity, identity, and social and political context (e.g., class, race, gender, ability, health and wellness, and so on) impact people’s lived experiences" (pg. 658). <br><br>

									<h3>Design Strategies for Social Justice</h3>

									<h4>Transformation</h4>

									Transformation means to not focus on the short term, due to the evolving nature of social justice, but instead to design for emergent social, economic, and political inequalities. The focus is not on immediate innovation but longterm changes to structural inequalities. This also lends to focusing beyond the individual-level, on a group- or social-level of intervention.
