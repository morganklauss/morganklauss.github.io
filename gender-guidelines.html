									<h1><a id="About">About this Document</a></h1>
									This document has been collectively generated by members of the SIGCHI community
									 whose research addresses gender representation in technology and the activist goal of gender equality.
									  We outline a pragmatic approach to fostering a research community that is inclusive of people with a 
									  variety of genders. We are particularly focused on creating space in our research methods, publications,
									   professional gatherings, and pedagogy for people who do not identify with the binary gender 
									   designations––men and women––that are pervasive in Western cultures, and for people whose genders
									    change and/or are fluid over time. In this document, we offer guidelines <a href="#Writers">for
											 Writers</a>, <a href="#Researchers">for Researchers</a>, and <a href="#Organizers">for
												  Organizers</a>.<br><br>
									
									We humbly recognize that gender is culturally, materially, and temporally situated, and
									 that it is experienced differently by those with intersecting identities. Rather than a set of
									  universal prescriptions, this document is intended to provide inroads to approaching gender in an
									   inclusive way. This document is situated within a specific present, geographically and culturally-
									   influenced (most of the authors work and/or live in the United States). Hence, it does not provide a 
									   set of absolute and essential rules for inclusivity, but rather offers opportunities for reflecting on
									    gender in different contexts.<br><br>
									
									The primary purpose of this document is to <b>encourage people to continue doing this work</b> by 
									providing helpful tools to refer back to. We acknowledge that mistakes happen (and the authors of this
									 document also make mistakes), sentiments change, and cultural concepts and social norms evolve. 
									 We also acknowledge that the authors had differing views on certain subjects and concepts throughout 
									 the creation of this document, showcasing that gender is a difficult and highly personal subject that 
									 needs to be handled with care.<br><br>

									<h2><a id="Context">CONTEXT AND MOTIVATION</a></h2>

									Gender plays a crucial role in all societies, scripting everyday social interactions and our personal narrative
									 identities. The concept of gender is being increasingly discussed as a complex and fluid facet of 
									 human identity in numerous fields, ranging from the social sciences—such as feminist and queer studies 
									 [7,18,29]—to the medical field [23,24,30], and in computing and HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)(e.g.
									  [1,13,35]). Alongside increased public awareness about transgender rights movement across the globe
									   (e.g. [3,42–44]), the academic conversation around gender increasingly involves transgender identity.<br><br>
									
									Human-computer interaction researchers have interrogated the experiences of gender in technology 
									design and use (e.g. [39]), as well as feminist orientations towards equitable research and interaction 
									design (e.g. [15]). As a field, through our choice of research topics (e.g. [36]) and professional 
									activities (e.g. <a href="https://sigchi.org/2017/06/internationalisation-diversity-and-inclusion-events-at-sponsored-conferences/" target="_blank">SIGCHI’s Internationalisation, Diversity and Inclusion events</a> [45]), we are
									 increasingly signaling our collective value of developing more inclusive, critical, and 
									 intersectional frameworks and approaches towards gender and other identities. <br><br>
									
									Yet, this type of cultural change takes concerted leadership efforts to affect “deep”
									 transformation. Along the way, there have been and will continue to be situations in which our
									  community caused harm and subsequently has been called out to reflect and do better (e.g. [11,46]). 
									  This document was born of one such reflective effort: a rejected workshop proposal turned informal 
									  <a href="https://medium.com/@haimson/gender-inclusivity-at-sigchi-b1cbee213faf" target="_blank">“lunchshop” hosted during CSCW 2018 by the authors</a> [31]. We hope this document will take a small but
									   practical step—in the tradition of Cavendar, Trewin and Hanson’s <a href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/" target="_blank">“Accessible Writing Guide”</a>  
									   [10]—in support of a more gender inclusive HCI, that intentionally addresses inclusion for
									    transgender individuals.<br><br>

									<h2><a id="Limitations">LIMITATIONS</a></h2>
									While recent movements have led to increased formal recognition for some trans people in
									 modern North America and Europe, more expansive views of gender are not new; there are myriad 
									 cultural contexts, both historical and current, where gender is not seen as a binary, 
									 biologically-rooted phenomenon (e.g. [40]). Racism and colonialism have often led to their 
									 suppression and the associated entrenchment of binary gender norms [26].<br><br>

									 The authors, contributors, and editors of this document recognize that we do not mirror the diversity of 
									 people across a range of gender identities. Further, we are not the originators of critical gender 
									 discourses. Thus, we recognize that our perspectives are incomplete.<br><br>

									 We highly encourage your feedback and recommendations for how to continuously improve this
									  document. Please send all comments, questions, and recommendations to <a href="mailto:genderguidelines@gmail.com">genderguidelines@gmail.com</a>.<br><br>

									<h1><a id="Writers">For Writers</a></h1>

									<h2><a id="Terms">GENDER TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS</a></h2>

									Language is a powerful tool—for inclusion and exclusion. The words and phrases we choose to describe 
									certain individuals or groups can contribute to increased marginalization of already underrepresented 
									groups. Our language choices may reflect biases and may reinforce hegemonic structures of power that are
									 already in place. Adopting inclusive language practices when discussing identity characteristics like
									  gender ensures equitable representation for people of all genders.<br><br>

									  As has been noted by other scholars [2,34,50], the way that we talk and write about gender is encased in 
									  powerful mechanisms for changing perceptions, attitudes, and actions. We do not expect researchers to be 
									  able to transition to inclusive participant sampling the day after these guidelines are published. But,
									   at a minimum, they should be able to write in a way that indicates (if, for example, they have only 
									   included people of binary genders) that they are aware of possible limitations in their sampling and/or 
									   gaps in the generalizability of their work.<br><br>

									   The following section of this guideline document outlines some ways of respectfully talking and 
									   writing about gender, and highlights some common terms surrounding transgender identity. We also 
									   highlight some issues about writing and discussing gender appropriately and equitably in current 
									   ACM guidelines and ways to best tackle these constraints.<br><br>

									<h3><a id="General"><i>GENERAL GUIDELINES</i></a></h3>

									When talking or writing about gender, there are many important steps one can take to make their
									 writing more gender inclusive. Primarily, these guidelines are meant to help authors write 
									 about gender as a complex construct rather than a simple binary category, and to avoid positioning 
									 some genders as more “normal” than other genders.<br><br>

									 The following guidelines summarize some general points we believe can be used to more 
									 accurately write about gender:<br><br>

									 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A"><a id="Guideline-A-1">✪ Guideline A-1: </a></b></font> Always identify people in the way 
										they self-identify (without pressuring participants to out themselves). Other guidelines delve 
										into more complexity and nuance surrounding gender, but you can rely on this basic principle.</li>
										<br>

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline A-2: </b></font> Use “they” as a gender neutral pronoun, 
										rather than “he or she,” “he/she,” or “s/he” (particularly when referencing a generic 
										person instead of a specific one.) Using explicitly gendered pronouns excludes non-binary individuals 
										(see <a href="#Nonbinary">definition</a>) and people who do not use solely binary “he” or “she” pronouns.</li>
										<br>

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline A-3:</b></font>  Try not refer to gender as sex-based (female/male) unless participants identify themselves that way. 
											(See <a href="#Gender-Sex">Gender vs. Sex</a> for more detail.) Instead, try to use identity-first language. 
											For example, instead of writing "Female participants were more likely to disagree" you could write 
											"Women were more likely to disagree." 										
										</li>
										<br>

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline A-4: </b></font>Use gender meaningfully in your writing. 
											Define what you mean by gender in your writing or research question. Tell the reader why it is
											 important or insightful to these contexts. Are you discussing gender as a concept, gendered 
											 experiences, or societal notions of gender?
										</li>
										<br>

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline A-5: </b></font>Do not refer to cisgender people as “normal.” 
											This positions transgender and/or non-binary individuals as unhealthy or abnormal. 
											Similarly, quotes around “transgender” and “non-binary” are to be avoided, as they 
											insinuate they are not real experiences.
										</li>
										<br>

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline A-6: </b></font>Do not position cisgender individuals as the default in
											 comparison to trans individuals. For example, using “women and trans women” implies that 
											 cisgender women are actually women, but transgender women are not. This invalidates a transgender 
											 person’s identity. Instead, you can just refer to them as “women.” If it is necessary to distinguish 
											 between cisgender and transgender women, state “cisgender and transgender women.”

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline A-7: </b></font>Avoid binary language. This includes things like “both sexes” or

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline A-8: </b></font>Do not define demographics of participants by the “outlier.” 
											For example, only stating that “47% of our participants were women” without also defining

											problematic statement. This positions men as the default within a binary understanding of

									<h3><a id="Defining-Gender"><i>DEFINING GENDER IN YOUR WRITING</i></a></h3>

									For different individuals, the following terms may overlap, be used interchangeably, or be consciously 
									avoided or disliked. There is nuance in writing about individuals with diverse gender identities that 
									cannot be encapsulated discretely or concretely in a “How To” guide. We outline some common 
									terms and definitions for those terms to help writers and researchers formulate a starting point.<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline B-1: </b></font>
											When discussing gender—and researching gender, as seen in the 
											<a href="#Researchers">For Researchers</a> section—do not limit your scope to binary and cisgender experiences. 
											Remember to include transgender and non-binary into your definitions of gender.
											</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Transgender">TRANSGENDER</a></h4>

									Transgender (also shortened to trans) refers to an individual whose gender differs from the one
									 which they were assigned at birth. Transgender individuals may use many terms to more 
									 granularly define their genders. 
									 <br><br>
									<h5><a id="Transgender-Women-Men"><i>Transgender Women and Men</i></a></h5>

									Transgender women may refer to themselves as one or more of the following:<br><br>

									<ul>
										<li>
											AMAB (assigned male at birth)
										</li>
										<li>
											MTF / M2F (male to female)
										</li>
										<li>
											Trans female
										</li>
										<li>
											Trans woman
										</li>
										<li>
											Trans feminine (trans fem or trans femme)
										</li>
										<li>
											Female or woman (without any reference to their previously-assigned gender)
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									Transgender men may refer to themselves as one or more of the following:<br><br>

										<li>
											AFAB (assigned female at birth)
										</li>
										<li>
											FTM / F2M (female to male)
										</li>
										<li>
											Trans male
										</li>
										<li>
											Trans man
										</li>
										<li>
											Trans masculine (trans masc)
										</li>
										<li>
											Male or man (without any reference to their previously-assigned gender)
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline B-2: </b></font>
											There is no universal term that can be applied to binary trans identities. 
											Individuals may be offended by some terms others find acceptable. 
											Using some terms risks respectful relationships with participants. 
											For example, you cannot refer to all trans women as MTF; MTF is a term that may be 
											offensive to some trans women. It is important to ensure individuals are able to define
											 their own identities.
											</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									Furthermore, some of the above terms are not necessarily tied to binary gender; non-binary individuals may refer to themselves as trans fem, trans masc, or other traditionally “feminine” or “masculine” terms.<br><br>

									<h5><a id="Nonbinary"><i>Non-Binary</i></a></h5>

									Non-binary identities do not align with binary conceptions of male and female. Non-binary individuals also 
									do not identify with the gender they are assigned at birth, thus are often considered to fall under the
									 larger “trans umbrella.” However, some non-binary individuals do not identify as trans.
									  Non-binary individuals may refer to themselves as one or more of the following:<br><br>

									  <ul>
										  <li>“Enby”</li>
										  <li>Trans masc or trans fem</li>
										  <li>Non-binary butch / non-binary femme</li>
										  <li>Bigender (identifying with two genders / gender expressions)</li>
										  <li>Androgyne</li>
										  <li>Genderless</li>
										  <li>Gender Neutral</li>
										  <li>Neutrois</li>
										  <li>Agender (not subscribing to any gender)</li>
										  <li>Genderfluid (moving between different genders)</li>
										  <li>Genderqueer (actively subverting a binary notion of gender)</li>
									  </ul>
									  <br>

									  Non-binary people might additionally or separately identify as any number of different genders.<br><br>

									<h5><a id="Trans-Nonbinary"><i>Transgender and/or Non-Binary vs. Binary and Non-Binary Trans People</i></a></h5>

									Some argue that writing “transgender and/or non-binary” positions non-binary individuals outside of the 
									transgender community, which actively erases the identity and belonging of non-binary individuals, 
									and suggest referring to “binary and non-binary trans people,” if the difference is relevant. 
									Others feel that this may inaccurately place a trans identity label on some non-binary people who 
									themselves would not claim such an identity, thus going against <a href="#Guideline-A-1">Guideline A-1</a>. 
									We encourage researchers to carefully consider these distinctions and classifications in research and 
									writing. In this piece, we have decided to use “transgender and/or non-binary” but acknowledge there are
									 differing opinions and experiences on this matter.<br><br>

									 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline B-4: </b></font>
											When using the term “transgender,” "trans," and referring to the trans umbrella, be cognizant
											 that this includes both binary and non-binary trans people. Be mindful of the different experiences
											  and perspectives binary and non-binary trans people have. For example, <a href="https://ironholds.org/nb-politics/" target="_blank">avoid generalizing 
											  binary trans perspectives to those of trans people as a whole</a> [21].
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Cisgender">CISGENDER</a></h4>

									The above genders contrast with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/23289252-2399614" target="_blank">cisgender</a>, 
									which refers to an individual whose gender reflects the one they were assigned at birth [4].<br><br>
									
									<h4><a id="Intersex">INTERSEX</a></h4>

									Intersex people have genetic, chromosomal, anatomic, and hormonal variations that <a href="https://ihra.org.au/style/" target="_blank">misalign with binary 
									conceptions of male or female characteristics</a>. Often, intersex people are subjected to genital mutilation 
									at an early age to make them fit to a potential binary gender assignment [12].
									<br><br>
									Intersex individuals may identify as either cisgender or transgender and/or non-binary, dependent upon 
									their alignment with the gender they were assigned through medical or social intervention, if any.
									<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Non-Conforming">GENDER NON-CONFORMING</a></h4>

									Gender non-conformity describes different actions, mannerisms, presentations, and/or genders that do not 
									necessarily conform to a specific social set of rules for the binary of man or woman. Someone may describe 
									themselves as gender non-conforming, but it is not necessarily used as an identifier. Anyone of any gender
									 identity may be gender non-conforming. A cisgender person may identify as gender non-conforming because
									  of their presentation, while a non-binary person may identify as gender non-conforming because their 
									  gender does not align within the binary. Gender non-conforming is a broad and fluid term that can be 
									  used by people to describe many aspects of their identity.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Incorrect-Terms">INCORRECT OR INAPPROPRIATE WAYS TO REFER TO TRANS PEOPLE</a></h4>

									There are numerous words that are viewed as inappropriate and offensive ways to refer to transgender
									 individuals, many of which are outdated terms once utilized by medical professionals (see the section 
									 on <a href="#Medicalized">Medicalized and Stigmatized Terms</a> for specifically medical terms to avoid). In the following 
									 guidelines, we define some of these terms and why they should be avoided unless directly quoted from 
									 participants:<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-1: </b></font>
											<i>Transgendered</i> is considered an incorrect and offensive way of referring to a 
											transgender individual, due to its insinuation that being transgender is something that happens to 
											someone. It centers an individual’s gender transition (and assumes all trans individuals choose 
											transition), rather than an individual’s identity.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-2: </b></font>
											<i>Transgenders</i> (or <i>“a transgender”</i>) is similarly incorrect and offensive. Choosing to use 
											transgender as a noun, rather than an adjective, removes “people” or “individuals,” thus dehumanizing 
											transgender people. It would be much like referring to gay or queer individuals as “the gays” or “the 
											queers,” which is now also viewed as inappropriate.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-3: </b></font>
											<i>Transsexual</i> is a term that was once more popularly used in psychological and medical literature
											 to describe people who have physically transitioned. While some individuals may still identify as 
											 transsexual, is not considered an umbrella term in the way that transgender is, and should thus be 
											 avoided to describe transgender people broadly. Many transgender individuals find this term offensive due
											  to its centering of surgical procedures and binary gender expectations.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-4: </b></font>
											<i>Transwoman</i> or <i>transman</i> are also terms to broadly avoid save for instances where
											 an individual self identifies. Transgender is viewed as an adjective to describe a person. 
											 For example, conflating trans and woman to transwoman insinuates a transgender woman is a 
											 separate and new gender. This is seen as insinuating a transgender woman is not actually a woman. 
											 Instead, separate “trans” (the adjective) from the individual (the noun). For example: 
											 “trans woman,” “trans men,” “trans people.”
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-5: </b></font>
											<i>Transvestite</i> refers to a person who is not necessarily transgender, but rather a
											 trans or cis person who “cross-dresses.” Both cross-dresser and transvestite are terms 
											 that should be used only if an individual uses them to describe themselves.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h5><a id="Preferred-Pronouns"><i>Preferred Pronouns</i></a></h5>

									The term “preferred pronouns” is being phased out of trans terminology due to the inference that using a 
									person’s correct pronouns is a “preference,” rather than a matter of respect.<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-5: </b></font>
											It is best to ask, “What pronouns do you use?” or “What are your pronouns?” instead of “What are 
											your preferred pronouns?”
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h5><a id="Medicalized"><i>Medicalized and Stigmatized Terms</i></a></h5>

									Some terms are considered to be heavily stigmatizing to transgender individuals, particularly 
									terms that have ties to historical medicalization and dehumanization of transgender individuals [28]. 
									It is best to avoid using these terms unless quoted directly from participants. We provide two 
									examples of medicalized and stigmatized terms in the following guidelines:<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-7: </b></font>
											Do not refer to the state of being trans as <i>transgenderism</i>. The ism postfix carries 
											connotations that being transgender is a choice and that trans people can simply avoid being
											 trans. It can also be read as a medicalized or prescriptive term for being trans.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline C-8: </b></font>
											<i>Gender Identity Disorder</i> is a now-defunct term for gender dysphoria, 
											the psychological term for the experience of gendered dissonance between one’s physical 
											form and how one expects it to be. In the event that you are referring specifically to 
											dysphoria, “gender dysphoria” alone is an acceptable term, but note that being dysphoric
											 is not the same as being trans, and avoid equating the two. Regardless, one should avoid 
											 “Gender Identity Disorder,” since the term “disorder” carries substantial stigma.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
								
									<h3><a id="Dynamics"><i>THE DYNAMICS OF GENDERED LANGUAGE</i></a></h3>
									
									<h4><a id="Masc-Fem">MASCULINE VS. MALE / FEMININE VS. FEMALE</a></h4>

									Although many people who identify with the term “masculine” may also identify as men, 
									not all people who are masculine are necessarily male. Masculine people may be non-binary 
									or women as well. Similarly, not everyone who identifies with the term “feminine” may be a woman. 
									Feminine people may be non-binary or men.<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline D-1: </b></font>
											We advise avoiding conflating masculinity with men and femininity with women. 
											While discussing masculinity and femininity and its societal relationships with
											 certain genders may be necessary, one cannot assume that a woman is feminine, or is
											  not masculine, and so forth.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Pronouns">PRONOUNS AND GENDER</a></h4>

									Like masculine and feminine, pronouns may not always align with gender in societally expected ways.
									 For example, a trans woman might use they/them, rather than she/her.<br><br>

									 There are many different pronouns, including neopronouns. <a href="https://nonbinary.wiki/w/index.php?title=List_of_neopronouns" target="_blank">Neopronouns are non-binary pronouns 
									 that replace the use of the singular “they,” such as ey/em or xe/xir</a> [49]. The non-binary alternative to
									  the gendered honorifics (Mr., Ms., Mrs.,) is Mx.<br><br>

									  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline D-2: </b></font>
											It is best to clarify with individuals what their pronouns are, rather than assuming they
											 indicate their identity. We discuss ways to do this with participants in the section on 
											 <a href="#Methods">Gender Inclusive Research Methods</a>.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Identify-Identity">"IDENTIFY AS" VS. IDENTITY</a></h4>

									Discussing the ways people identify can be tricky. While it is appropriate to ask for a participants’ 
									gender, we recommend avoiding statements that may position a trans person’s gender as inauthentic.
									 For example, “Celine (a trans woman) identifies as a woman”or "Celine is female-identified" may insinuate
									  that Celine is not actually a woman, but simply identifies as one.<br><br>

									  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline D-3: </b></font>
											Whether to use the phrase “identifies as” can be highly contextual; we encourage authors to think
											 critically about these statements before using them. Because “identify as” usually connotes that 
											 trans people’s genders are not to be taken as seriously as cis people’s genders, this term 
											 should generally be avoided unless participants use it themselves (e.g., “I identify as trans.”)
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Identity">GENDER IDENTITY</a></h4>

									People are a certain gender, which is part of their identity. Sometimes, using a term like  
									“gender identity” implies that trans people’s genders are less real than cisgender people’s
									 genders.<br><br>

									 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline D-4: </b></font>
											Refrain from using "gender identity"
											 to refer to trans people if you would not use it for cis people
											  (unless participants specifically use that language themselves). 
											  The word “gender” will usually serve the same purpose.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Sex">GENDER VS. SEX</a></h4>

									The language surrounding gender and sex is extremely complex, nuanced, and often political. While 
									some view gender and sex as separate ideas (in which gender is internal and sex is biological), many 
									trans people believe that differentiating between the two can be seen as transphobic and genital 
									essentialist. Many trans people do not view their biological sex as separate from their gender identity,
									 regardless of first and secondary sex characteristics. This can also be regarded as a form of intersex 
									 erasure.<br><br>

									 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline D-5: </b></font>
											We suggest only referring to sex when the context is relevant, and to define its relevance 
											to the study (for example, in <a href="#Health-Research">medical studies</a>). When referring to sex, use the term “sex 
											assigned at birth” when referring to transgender individuals. Do not use terms such as
											 “born a man.”
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
								
									<h3><a id="Intersections"><i>RACIAL, ETHNIC, AND CULTURAL INTERSECTIONS WITH GENDER</i></a></h3>
									
									Another crucial aspect of discussing and writing about gender is the way that gender intersects
									 with other social identities. Racial, ethnic, and cultural identity is often intricately intertwined 
									 with gender and the way gender is experienced and discussed. Thus, is it key to address concepts of 
									 gender from an intersectional lens to acknowledge the overlapping ways that gender, race, skin color,
									  ethnicity, ability, class, and other marginalizations impact one another [8].<br><br>

									It is also important to consider the ways that gendered terms and concepts may vary by race, skin color,
									 ethnicity, and culture. For example, some non-binary trans people prefer to use terms such as Latine or
									  Latinx, over gendered terms like Latina or Latino. Other cultures also do not necessarily share the same
									   binary views on gender as the dominant Western culture featured in much HCI research [51]. It is 
									   always best to familiarize oneself with the gendered culture of a study site to best understand these
										differences.<br><br>
										
										<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
											<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline E-1: </b></font>
												To respect the racial, ethnic, and cultural differences in how gender is conceptualized,
												 experienced, and discussed, refer to participants’ descriptions of their own identities
												  and define these terms when necessary.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br>

									<h3><a id="Glossary"><i>A GLOSSARY OF USEFUL TERMS</i></a></h3>

									<h4><a id="Misgendering">MISGENDERING</a></h4>
									Misgendering refers to the (intentional or unintentional) misidentification of a person’s gender. 
									A person may misgender a trans person by using the wrong pronouns or the wrong gender for them. 
									For example, a trans masculine person may use he/him but be called she/her. Or a non-binary person 
									may be referred to as a woman.<br><br>

									Although this may seem like a small issue, it is not; because of the ubiquity of the experience, 
									and the way that misgendering invalidates and delegitimizes trans peoples’ existences, it can have 
									substantial effects. Research has shown that misgendering decreases self-worth, increases felt stigma 
									and reduces overall wellbeing [25,33].<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Passing">PASSING</a></h4>

									Some transgender individuals may refer to the concept of “passing”: being read as a specific
									 gender by other people (this concept stems from histories of “racial passing” [16]). Some individuals 
									 may discuss passing as their correct gender. For example, a transgender woman may discuss passing as a 
									 cisgender woman in the eyes of others. Others may talk about passing as the incorrect gender, often to 
									 discuss the experiences they have being perceived as that gender. For example, a transgender woman may 
									 discuss passing as a cisgender man in her everyday life, and her thoughts and feelings about that
									  experience. This highlights the difference between gender (one’s actual gender identity) and being 
									  gendered (the way one’s gender is perceived).<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Passing-Privilege">PASSING PRIVILEGE</a></h4>

									“Passing Privilege” is a term used to describe the privilege and safety binary trans individuals are 
									awarded when they pass as cisgender (and their actual gender, as in, they are not misgendered). 
									Passing is a disputed concept within trans circles due to the pressure and expectation for trans 
									individuals to fit into binary gender roles [38]. While coveted by some binary trans individuals,
									 passing is often inaccessible to many trans people, particularly non-binary individuals living within
									  binary societies. Meaning, non-binary trans people often cannot “pass” as their true non-binary
									   gender.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="HRT">HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HRT)</a></h4>

									Hormone Replacement Therapy is a medical process which some, but not all, 
									transgender and/or non-binary individuals choose to undergo. This process involves the administration
									 of hormonal medications to induce specific secondary sexual characteristics. It is often shortened 
									 to HRT.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Affirmation-Surgery">GENDER AFFIRMATION SURGERY</a></h4>

									Some binary and non-binary transgender individuals may choose to undergo gender affirmation 
									surgery, a medical process in which an individual undergoes surgery to align their body more with
									 their gender identity. Some individuals may still use the older term “sex reassignment surgery,”
									  but it is less accepted among the spectrum of trans individuals.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Dysphoria">GENDER DYSPHORIA</a></h4>

									The psychological term for the experience of gendered dissonance between one’s
									 physical form and how one expects it to be. However, one does not have to have gender dysphoria to be trans.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Euphoria">GENDER EUPHORIA</a></h4>
									In contrast to <a href="#Gender-Dysphoria">Gender Dysphoria</a>, Gender Euphoria describes the affirmative
									 and often euphoric emotions trans and/or non-binary people experience when adopting markers of their 
									 gender. For example, the affirmative feeling when a trans masc person might feel when getting their 
									 haircut. The feeling can also occur when others recognize a person’s correct gender or use the correct
									  pronouns unprompted.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Transition">GENDER TRANSITION</a></h4>

									The concept of transition or gender transition may be discussed in various ways. Some binary 
									and non-binary trans individuals may choose to undergo medical transition, which may involve
									 HRT and/or gender affirmation surgery. This may go hand-in-hand with social transition, transitioning 
									 gender in one’s social life by adopting different pronouns and/or a different name, and so on. 
									 Furthermore, some individuals may have access to legal transition, the process of changing one’s
									  gender on legal documentation, such as IDs and birth certificates (this process is often 
									  inaccessible to many due to financial and lawful constraints).<br><br>

									  Social transition does not necessarily require medical transition. Some binary and non-binary 
									  trans individuals choose to never undergo medical transitional procedures, or may opt for only
									   one or a few options.<br><br>

									   <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline F-1: </b></font>
											Do not discuss transition as either an end goal of all trans people or a linear, fixed experience.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Trans-Feminine">TRANS FEMININE</a></h4>

									Some people adopt the term trans feminine if they identify with femininity. However, a trans
									 feminine person may not identify with the label “woman.”<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Trans-Masculine">TRANS MASCULINE</a></h4>
									Some people adopt the term trans masculine if they identify with masculinity. However, a trans
									 masculine person may not identify with the label “man.”<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Transphobia">TRANSPHOBIA, TRANSMISOYNY, AND TRANSMISOGYNOIR</a></h4>

									Transphobia describes discrimination and prejudice against transgender people, and may 
									include negative feelings such as dislike, discomfort, disgust, and anger. Transphobia may be 
									internalized by transgender people, leading to expectations of transnormativity—specific, 
									acceptable, and normalized behaviors on the part of trans people. Transphobia may be targeted 
									specifically at certain groups, including specific discrimination against non-binary trans 
									individuals. Transmisogyny describes the specific discrimination and prejudice experienced by 
									transgender women and trans feminine individuals [37]. Transmisogynoir, (built off Dr. Moya
									 Bailey’s concept of misogynoir [5]) describes the intersecting discrimination and prejudice
									  experienced by transgender women of color [41].<br><br>

									Different types of study contexts require asking about and reporting participants’ genders in different 
									ways. Several of the factors that influence how to request and report gender in HCI research are 
									research methods, research setting, and research focus.<br><br>

									<h3><a id="Research-Methods"><i>RESEARCH METHODS</i></a></h3>

									HCI researchers use many different types of methods, and each of them require different techniques 
									for respectfully asking participants about gender and then reporting gender in the research write-up.
									 In the following sections, we provide guidelines for requesting gender from participants based on
									  different research methods.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Interviews-Ethnography">INTERVIEWS AND ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES</a></h4>

									In interviews and ethnographic studies, while researchers have close contact with participants and 
									it may seem simple to ask about gender, asking about demographics (including gender) may feel invasive 
									and may break the rapport that the interviewer or ethnographer has built up with participants. If that 
									is the case, consider this guideline.<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-1: </b></font>
											Ask interviewees or participants from an ethnography or design study to fill out a short 
											demographic survey (via email or other means) at some later point after interacting with them, 
											which provides a less obtrusive way of asking about gender. Provide an open-ended text box for 
											gender.</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Social-Media">SOCIAL MEDIA DATA ANALYSIS</a></h4>

									In social media data analysis, researchers may have no contact with research participants at all, and may
									 instead rely on inferring gender by making assumptions based on people’s names or pictures, or even
									  algorithmically. Research has shown that these practices can be particularly harmful for trans 
									  and/or non-binary people [14,22].<br><br>

									  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-2: </b></font>
											In social media data analysis, always use user-generated gender descriptions if available. 
											If user-generated genders are not available, don't assume users’ genders based on name, username, 
											or appearance. Do not assume gender based on pronouns, or pronouns based on gender. If gender and
											 pronouns are unknown, assign a gender-neutral identifier (e.g., “P2”) and use gender-neutral pronouns
											  like they/them.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Surveys">SURVEYS</a></h4>

									How to respectfully report gender on surveys has been a tricky question for many HCI researchers [17].
									 While the specifics of how exactly to do this for every case is beyond the scope of these guidelines,
									  we direct readers to Spiel et al.’s forthcoming Interactions article which will detail best 
									  practices in gender inclusive survey design and <a href="https://drnikki.github.io/open-demographics/questions/gender.html" target="_blank">Stevens' Open Demographics resource</a>. In brief, 
									  here are a few guidelines:<br><br>

									  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-3: </b></font>
											For surveys with a small sample size (i.e., reasonable to manually code), provide an open-ended text box.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-4: </b></font>
											For surveys with a large sample size (i.e., not reasonable to manually code), a good 
											survey instrument (suitable for most Western contexts) includes the following gender 
											options: woman, man, non-binary, prefer not to disclose, prefer to self-describe: ______.
											 Surveys should allow participants to choose multiple options (e.g., some people are both
											  woman and non-binary).
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-5: </b></font>
											Avoid using the term “Other” on surveys, as it implies gender norms that
											 are othering to non-binary participants.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-6: </b></font>
											Make it optional for participants to report their gender on surveys.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h3><a id="Research-Settings"><i>RESEARCH SETTINGS</i></a></h3>

									This section provides guidance on how to respectfully request gender from research participants
									 also varies depending on the research setting.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Private-Settings">PRIVATE RESEARCH SETTINGS</a></h4>

									In 1:1 settings with researchers and participants (e.g., interviews), it is possible to respectfully
									 ask the participant their gender and what pronouns they use (see <a href="#Methods">Research Methods</a> above for strategies).
									  It can be helpful to build rapport with participants before asking for this information.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Group-Settings">GROUP SETTINGS</a></h4>

									In group settings, such as participatory design sessions and focus groups, 
									give people the opportunity to share this information at the beginning of the session and make 
									sure to use and respect people’s names and pronouns. At the same time, allow people the option 
									of sharing gender information privately with the researchers rather than publicly with the group. 
									Gender is usually not considered sensitive information, but it may be for those who are in
									 transition.<br><br>

									 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-7: </b></font>
											Facilitate name and pronoun go-rounds at the beginning of group research activities, but do not make 
											pronoun sharing mandatory. Use and respect participants’ names and pronouns and correct other 
											participants if they refer to people incorrectly.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h3><a id="Research-Focus"><i>RESEARCH FOCUS</i></a></h3>

									How to request gender information and report about gender does vary some based on the research project’s 
									focus. We place these into four main categories: 1) research projects about gender broadly (e.g., 
									“differences in user behaviors between genders”); 2) Research projects about trans and/or non-binary 
									populations (e.g., “binary and non-binary trans experiences using a system”); 3) Research that requires 
									specific personal health data dependent on “biological” sex characteristics; and 4) Research not focused
									 on gender.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Research">RESEARCH PROJECTS ABOUT GENDER, BROADLY</a></h4>

									For research projects looking at gender differences, it is imperative to ask participants about gender, 
									using the following guidelines:<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-8: </b></font>
											In research projects about gender, include non-binary genders (e.g., do not simply 
											report “differences in how men and women use a system”).
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-9: </b></font>
											Do not assume a participant is trans unless they disclose this to you.
											 If a participant asks you to not disclose their trans identity, do not disclose it.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-9: </b></font>
											When reporting participant gender, only report as trans those who openly identified
											 as trans, which will essentially be a lower bound of actual trans participants in
											  your study. For example: “3% of participants openly identified as trans; we did not
											   know whether other participants were trans or cisgender."
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Trans-Research">RESEARCH PROJECTS ABOUT TRANSGENDER AND/OR NON-BINARY PEOPLE</a></h4>

									For research projects about transgender and/or non-binary populations, it makes sense to ask and report about gender in much more complex ways than for other studies. For studies with a small sample size, allow people to self-identify however they choose, and report genders this way (just as you would for any other study). We recommend using a two-step or multidimensional gender question for trans-focused studies with large sample sizes. A two-step or multidimensional procedure asks the participant their assigned sex at birth, followed by their current gender and/or lived gender. For the latter, use Guideline G-11:<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-11: </b></font>
											For studies with a large sample size that are specifically focused on binary 
											and non-binary trans populations, use a two-step or multidimensional method
											 to identify different types of trans participants.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Health-Research">RESEARCH PROJECTS ABOUT HEALTH AND/OR MEDICINE</a></h4>

									In studies that require specific personal health data dependent on “biological” sex characteristics 
									(prominent in health and medicine fields but relatively rare in HCI studies), it may be necessary to
									 distinguish between cisgender and transgender participants. In these cases, a well-designed two-step
									  survey procedure can enable researchers to identify between cisgender, binary trans, and non-binary 
									  trans participants. However, it is important to note that many trans bodies change over time, and 
									  a gender question on a survey will not tell you which body parts and hormone levels each person has.
									   If you need that data, it is best to ask those questions directly.<br><br>

									   <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-12: </b></font>
											For health or medical-related HCI studies that require personal health data dependent 
											on “biological” characteristics, you may consider using a two-step or multidimensional
											 survey question method to distinguish between cisgender and trans participants.
											  Understand that this question will not give you accurate data about hormone levels 
											  or body parts. If these are relevant, you should inquire into these explicitly.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Non-Gender-Research">RESEARCH PROJECTS NOT FOCUSED ON RESEARCH</a></h4>

									For research not focused on gender, researchers should still carefully evaluate whether and how they
									 should ask participants about gender. We recommend still requesting and reporting participants’ genders 
									 even if a study is not specifically focused on gender. This allows gender diversity to remain visible and 
									 enables readers to evaluate the gender diversity of the study sample. For instance, a study’s 
									 participants may be 80% men, which should be reported, so that readers and reviewers can  assess the 
									 limitations of a given study appropriately and note the lack of gender diversity represented.<br><br>

									 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-13: </b></font>
											Even for research not focused on gender, we recommend still requesting and 
											reporting participants’ genders. Include non-binary genders, and also follow <a href="#Guideline-A-1">Guideline A-1</a>.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h3><a id="Reporting-Gender"><i>REPORTING GENDER IN RESEARCH</i></a></h3>

									<h4><a id="Participant-Gender">PARTICIPANT GENDER MAY CHANGE DURING RESEARCH STUDY</a></h4>

									Gender is complex, personal, and changing. Just because a participant in your study is a certain
									gender now, does not mean that they will still be that gender during the next phase of your study, 
									or when your paper is published. Thus, consider the following guideline when writing your results:<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									   <li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-14: </b></font>
										   Consider that research participants’ genders may be fluid and impermanent. Acknowledge this 
										   explicitly when reporting on their gender.	
									   </li>
								   </ul>
								   <br>

									<h4><a id="Participant-Disclosure">DISCLOSURE OF PARTICIPANT GENDER</a></h4>

									Disclosure is another important matter when considering how to report trans and non-binary participants’
									 genders. Because you may have relatively few trans participants in your study, even if you give these
									  participants pseudonyms, you risk “outing” participants by reporting their gender along with other 
									  characteristics. For example, let’s say that in a qualitative study you report that one of your
									   participants is “Sid (pseudonym), a non-binary 27 year old baker from Columbia, Missouri.” There may 
									   only be one 27 year old non-binary baker in Columbia, so it becomes clear to some readers who your 
									   participant is, which compromises their confidentiality as a research participant. Additionally, if
										Sid has not disclosed their non-binary identity to certain people who end up reading your research
										 paper, this puts them in a precarious and possibly dangerous position.<br><br>

										 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
											<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-15: </b></font>
												When reporting participant characteristics and demographics, take extra care to anonymize
												 and pseudonymize trans participants’ identities. When in doubt, ask participants how they
												  would like their identity and demographics reported in the paper.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Multiplicity">REPORTING GENDER MULTIPLICITY</a></h4>

									Another part of gender’s complexity is its multiplicity. Some people identify as multiple gender categories (e.g., a non-binary trans woman), or people’s identity and gender presentation may differ in different settings. Attempting to contain each person into only one category reduces people’s complex experiences, which does not benefit research. The following two guidelines address this:<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-16: </b></font>
											When reporting research participants’ genders in aggregate, allow gender categories to add up to greater than 100%.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-17: </b></font>
											When including gender as a variable in statistical models, allow people to be part of multiple 
											categories if this best describes their identity as they have reported it to you. If this is not
											 possible for statistical or mathematical reasons, describe it as a limitation.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Gender-Visualization">GENDER VISUALIZATION</a></h4>

									Finally, gender’s complexity beyond the binary is important to consider when visualizing research results:<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline G-18: </b></font>
											When visualizing data, including using visual mechanisms to represent research findings or 
											participant demographics, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066?origin=crossref">avoid using stereotypically coded male/female symbols</a>, including icons, 
											colors (e.g., pink/blue), and patterns that have historically been used to reinforce a binary 
											and/or fixed view on gender [19]. 
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<p style="font-size:.8vw;">Note: Many of these guidelines have similarities with other 
										demographic categories, such as race/ethnicity [32].
									</p><br>

									<h3><a id="Research-Process"><i>GENDER INCLUSIVITY THROUGHOUT THE RESEARCH PROCESS</i></a></h3>

									It is important to consider gender inclusivity at each step of the research process. In this section, we
									 offer guidelines on gender-inclusive practices when initiating HCI research projects and considering
									  gender’s role in a project’s theoretical underpinnings.<br><br>

									  While these guidelines are most relevant to the first two categories of research projects described
									   in the <a href="#Research-Focus">Research Focus</a> section (i.e., research projects about gender broadly and research projects
										about binary and/or non-binary trans populations), they can also inform interdisciplinary research
										 that is not specifically focused on gender but considers human experiences more broadly in relation
										  to technology.<br><br>

									<h4><a id="Research-Initiation">INITIATING RESEARCH PROJECTS</a></h4>

									Thinking about gender equity should begin early on in the research process when research questions
									 are formed, rather than as afterthoughts. It is important for researchers to be aware of the large
									  and dynamic body of research on gender and its different aspects and to ensure that their research
									   both draws on current and relevant understandings and also contributes to this larger discourse by
										addressing meaningful and relevant questions.  One approach is to consult with other researchers and
										 practitioners who work in relevant areas. Additionally, discussing research questions with 
										 representative members of a participant community can provide insights into what elements are
										  relevant from their perspectives. An important consideration when consulting others about research
										   questions is to strive to get feedback from people with perspectives other than one’s own.<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline H-1: </b></font>
											If you are a non-trans person considering how to do research involving binary and/or non-binary 
											trans populations, it makes sense to critically reflect on: 1) how and why you want to approach
											 this research topic; 2) how to meaningfully include trans people as part of your research team;
											  and 3) how you can lead a project respectfully while acknowledging your privilege. 
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline H-3: </b></font>
											Get early feedback on your Research Questions from trans researchers and practitioners. However,
											 it is important to (formally) recognize the labor trans individuals may have to put into providing
											  this feedback [6]. Furthermore, many trans researchers may not be formally out in different research
											   or workplace settings. If a trans individual is unable or unwilling to give you feedback or
												guidance on your work, it may be appropriate to: (1) ask them to recommend other trans researchers
												 to reach out to or (2) reach out to other researchers who do work with transgender individuals.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline H-3: </b></font>
											When working as part of a research team, it is important that everyone respects one 
											another’s choices about whether or not to disclose their gender. In other words, there
											 should not be pressure or expectation that researchers or practitioners self-disclose, 
											 even if this is relevant to the research project. Never assume a status of disclosure when 
											 writing about trans people, even if you know them well.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<h4><a id="Theoretical-Research">THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS</a></h4>

									As described in the <a href="#Writers">For Writers</a> and <a href="#Researchers">Researchers</a> chapter of this document, gender is multifaceted
									 and dynamic and researchers should not assume a common, simplified understanding when discussing it. 
									 Current ways of thinking about gender are the result of many years of gender research and theory across
									  different disciplines. Researchers should be transparent about the theoretical underpinnings of key
									   concepts in relation to gender that they draw on in their research.<br><br>

									   Research has shown that many engineering and design projects have historically 
									   ignored nuanced theories of gender, leading to harmful outcomes [14,22]. Thus, it is important 
									   for HCI researchers whose topic focuses on gender to situate their work in the wider ongoing 
									   research discourse beyond technical fields, including fields like Gender Studies, Communication,
										Design, Media Studies, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Medicine, Education, etc. Currently,
										 efforts are underway to develop resources, such as the <a href="http://oliverhaimson.com/digitaltrans.html" target="_blank">Digital Trans Reading List</a> and the
										  <a href="https://www.thomasjbillard.com/tms/" target="_blank">Bibliography of Transgender Media Studies</a>.<br><br>

										  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
											<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline H-4: </b></font>
												When conducting research that involves gender, present clear definitions, explain the aspects of 
												gender you are researching, and, if necessary, justify the language you are using
												 (see <a href="#Terms">Gender Terminology and Concepts</a>).
											</li>
										</ul>
										<br>

										When consulting previous literature, researchers should be aware that many studies have 
										historically relied on erroneous, outdated or problematic theoretical underpinnings with respect 
										to gender. Relying on these previous work can impair current projects and introduce bias. 
										Given this possibility, researchers should investigate the sometimes implicit, definitions and 
										conceptualizations of gender present in previous work. They should question why these
										 conceptualizations are used, why they are problematic, and how can they be addressed in their own
										  research. <br><br>

									<h1><a id="Organizers">For Organizers</a></h1>

									The following chapter addresses how to approach gender inclusively when organizing
									 professional and academic events, gatherings, and conferences. <br><br>

									<h2><a id="Professional-Gatherings">GENDER INCLUSIVITY AT CONFERENCES AND PROFESSIONAL GATHERINGS</a></h2>

									<h3><a id="Conduct"><i>CODES OF CONDUCT</i></a></h3>

									Codes of conduct are meant to create safer spaces, particularly for marginalized populations
									 attending a conference or professional event. The
									  <a href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment" target="_blank">ACM Policy Against Harassment at

									 <a href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/faqs-policy-discrimination-and-harassment" target="_blank">Reporting Unacceptable Behavior at
									  ACM Activities</a> provide basic guidance, but are often not directly referenced on 
									  event pages or buried in other documents. Hence, awareness of how to appropriately
									   report harassment tends to be nonexistent. As harassment is mostly targeted at marginalized
										members of our community, they additionally might fear retribution and, if new
										 to an event, might also have difficulty trusting in organizers that appropriate 
										 action will be taken.<br><br>

										 <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
											<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline I-1: </b></font>
												The current default of addressing “event organizers (e.g., event chair, a SIG leader, or an 
												onsite ACM staff member)” is inappropriate considering hierarchical and access barriers to
												 these groups at certain levels. We suggest that event organizers provide an 
												 easily accessible code of conduct including expected behaviour, a standard harassment 
												 reporting and handling policy as well as a range of different individuals and
												  groups that can escalate in case this code of conduct has been violated.	
											</li>

										<br>

										<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
											<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline I-2: </b></font>

									<h3><a id="Technical-Programmes"><i>TECHNICAL PROGRAMMES</i></a></h3>

									Not all authors and volunteers at conferences and other events who create the technical

									 also to trans and/or non-binary trans people.<br><br>

											 about gender inclusivity in these guidelines, we also deem it crucial to ensure that 
											 people of color are represented in the selection of and as keynotes and panel speakers.
											  Speakers should be sensitized towards the values of our community. During the keynote,
											   the audience should ideally also have more than one opportunity to engage in the

									<h3><a id="Logistics"><i>LOGISTICS</i></a></h3>

									<h4><a id="Restrooms">RESTROOMS</a></h4>

									SIGCHI already provides several guidelines for making an event venue gender inclusive.

											During registration, participants should have the option to choose a

											 This is already practice for many SIGCHI conferences.

										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline I-15: </b></font>
											We highly recommend that pronouns are displayed on badges. If organizers choose 
											to do so, the pronouns should be readable and further distinguished by either color 
											or optional stickers in bright colors (which should avoid pink/blue and have enough 
											contrast for colorblind people to discern).
										</li>

									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline I-16: </b></font>
											People should also be able to opt-out having their pronouns displayed or
											 choose a neopronoun for themselves. These choices should be honored, which includes 
											 <a href="https://medium.com/@dmetaxak/chi-needs-to-be-more-gender-inclusive-cb0eb40f9b91" target="_blank">ensuring that "other" is not printed by the system</a> [11].

									</ul>
									<br>
							
									<h3><a id="Experience-Surveys"><i>EXPERIENCE SURVEYS</i></a></h3>

									Once the event ends, if there is a survey for attendees, it should allow for 
									detailed feedback on their accessibility for different marginalized groups.<br><br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline I-17: </b></font>
											This survey should ask specific questions about initiatives to make the 
											conference or event more inclusive. Ask specific questions pertaining to experiences. 
											Have a section asking for feedback about gender inclusion.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>

									<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
										<li><b><font style="color:#F53A3A">✪ Guideline I-18: </b></font>
											It might also be helpful to let attendees rate how essential certain initiatives
											 were for their participation and well-being. However, in interpreting the data, 
											 numbers might be less meaningful than qualitative responses. For example, even if there is
											  only one participant who found a specific initiative necessary for their attendance, event
											   organizers should still consider institutionalizing this effort.
